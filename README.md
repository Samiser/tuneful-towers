# Tuneful Towers

![several colourful towers firing at some encroaching enemies](./screenshot.png)

a musical tower defence game where you generate music by placing and using your
defences!

this game was made for godot wild jam 80, and it's also my first ever entry into
a game jam.

you can play it on [itch.io](https://samiser.itch.io/tuneful-towers)!
